launchalert
===========

Theos test project. Not for release.

Clone or download zip to have a quick Theos project to test your setup.

Requires $THEOS to be exported by the shell before running `make`.

Test consists of a UIAlertView popping on launching applications. Requires modification to use SBAlertItems to workaround the fact that UIAlertViews have been deprecated.
